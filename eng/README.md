# Contributor Reporting (Maintainers) 🚧

This directory contains a lightweight helper to generate human-readable reports about missing contributors.

- `contributor-report.mjs` — generates a markdown report of merged PRs for missing contributors (includes shared helpers).
- `add-missing-contributors.mjs` — on-demand maintainer script to automatically add missing contributors to `.all-contributorsrc` (infers contribution types from merged PR files, then runs the all-contributors CLI).

## Key notes for maintainers

- Reports are generated on-demand and output to `reports/contributor-report.md` for human review.
- The report output is intentionally minimal: a single list of affected PRs and one command to add missing contributor(s).
- This repository requires full git history for accurate analysis. In CI, set `fetch-depth: 0`.

## On-demand scripts (not CI)

These are maintainer utilities. They are intentionally on-demand only (but could be wired into CI later).

### `add-missing-contributors.mjs`

- Purpose: detect missing contributors, infer contribution types from their merged PR files, and run `npx all-contributors add ...` to update `.all-contributorsrc`.
- Requirements:
	- GitHub CLI (`gh`) available (used to query merged PRs).
	- `.all-contributorsrc` exists.
	- Auth token set to avoid the anonymous GitHub rate limits:
		- Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` (preferred), or `GH_TOKEN` for the `gh` CLI.
		- If you use `PRIVATE_TOKEN` locally, `contributor-report.mjs` will map it to `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## Graceful shutdown

- `contributor-report.mjs` calls `setupGracefulShutdown('script-name')` from `eng/utils/graceful-shutdown.mjs` early in the file to attach signal/exception handlers.

## Testing & maintenance

- Helper functions have small, deterministic behavior and include JSDoc comments.
- The `getMissingContributors` function in `contributor-report.mjs` is the single source of truth for detecting missing contributors from `all-contributors check` output.
