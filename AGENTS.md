# AGENTS.md

## Project Overview

The Awesome GitHub Copilot repository is a community-driven collection of custom agents, prompts, and instructions designed to enhance GitHub Copilot experiences across various domains, languages, and use cases. The project includes:

- **Agents** - Specialized GitHub Copilot agents that integrate with MCP servers
- **Prompts** - Task-specific prompts for code generation and problem-solving
- **Instructions** - Coding standards and best practices applied to specific file patterns
- **Skills** - Self-contained folders with instructions and bundled resources for specialized tasks
- **Collections** - Curated collections organized around specific themes and workflows

## Setup Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Build the project (generates README.md)
npm run build

# Validate collection manifests
npm run collection:validate

# Create a new collection
npm run collection:create -- --id <collection-id> --tags <tags>

# Validate agent skills
npm run skill:validate

# Create a new skill
npm run skill:create -- --name <skill-name>
```

## Development Workflow

### Working with Agents, Prompts, Instructions, and Skills

All agent files (`*.agent.md`), prompt files (`*.prompt.md`), and instruction files (`*.instructions.md`) must include proper markdown front matter. Agent Skills are folders containing a `SKILL.md` file with frontmatter and optional bundled assets:

#### Agent Files (*.agent.md)
- Must have `description` field (wrapped in single quotes)
- File names should be lower case with words separated by hyphens
- Recommended to include `tools` field
- Strongly recommended to specify `model` field

#### Prompt Files (*.prompt.md)
- Must have `agent` field (value should be `'agent'` wrapped in single quotes)
- Must have `description` field (wrapped in single quotes, not empty)
- File names should be lower case with words separated by hyphens
- Recommended to specify `tools` if applicable
- Strongly recommended to specify `model` field

#### Instruction Files (*.instructions.md)
- Must have `description` field (wrapped in single quotes, not empty)
- Must have `applyTo` field specifying file patterns (e.g., `'**.js, **.ts'`)
- File names should be lower case with words separated by hyphens

#### Agent Skills (skills/*/SKILL.md)
- Each skill is a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file
- SKILL.md must have `name` field (lowercase with hyphens, matching folder name, max 64 characters)
- SKILL.md must have `description` field (wrapped in single quotes, 10-1024 characters)
- Folder names should be lower case with words separated by hyphens
- Skills can include bundled assets (scripts, templates, data files)
- Bundled assets should be referenced in the SKILL.md instructions
- Asset files should be reasonably sized (under 5MB per file)
- Skills follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification)

### Adding New Resources

When adding a new agent, prompt, instruction, or skill:

**For Agents, Prompts, and Instructions:**
1. Create the file with proper front matter
2. Add the file to the appropriate directory
3. Update the README.md by running: `npm run build`
4. Verify the resource appears in the generated README

**For Skills:**
1. Run `npm run skill:create` to scaffold a new skill folder
2. Edit the generated SKILL.md file with your instructions
3. Add any bundled assets (scripts, templates, data) to the skill folder
4. Run `npm run skill:validate` to validate the skill structure
5. Update the README.md by running: `npm run build`
6. Verify the skill appears in the generated README

### Testing Instructions

```bash
# Run all validation checks
npm run collection:validate
npm run skill:validate

# Build and verify README generation
npm run build

# Fix line endings (required before committing)
bash scripts/fix-line-endings.sh
```

Before committing:
- Ensure all markdown front matter is correctly formatted
- Verify file names follow the lower-case-with-hyphens convention
- Run `npm run build` to update the README
- **Always run `bash scripts/fix-line-endings.sh`** to normalize line endings (CRLF → LF)
- Check that your new resource appears correctly in the README

## Code Style Guidelines

### Markdown Files
- Use proper front matter with required fields
- Keep descriptions concise and informative
- Wrap description field values in single quotes
- Use lower-case file names with hyphens as separators

### JavaScript/Node.js Scripts
- Located in `eng/` and `scripts/` directories
- Follow Node.js ES module conventions (`.mjs` extension)
- Use clear, descriptive function and variable names

## Pull Request Guidelines

When creating a pull request:

1. **README updates**: New files should automatically be added to the README when you run `npm run build`
2. **Front matter validation**: Ensure all markdown files have the required front matter fields
3. **File naming**: Verify all new files follow the lower-case-with-hyphens naming convention
4. **Build check**: Run `npm run build` before committing to verify README generation
5. **Line endings**: **Always run `bash scripts/fix-line-endings.sh`** to normalize line endings to LF (Unix-style)
6. **Description**: Provide a clear description of what your agent/prompt/instruction does
7. **Testing**: If adding a collection, run `npm run collection:validate` to ensure validity
